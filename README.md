# Ether Coin Flip

Two players send ether to the smart contract. One player takes it all.

This is a tutorial dapp for learning how to build a fullstack web3 dapp using subgraphs for blockchain data, Solidity, and Next.js.

The ether coin flip smart contract is deployed to Sepolia testnet [here](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x345e39cd71f2b2f39d6dc0ce40381e420c38f845).

All blockchain data is provided by a [subgraph](https://thegraph.com/studio/subgraph/subgraph-ether-coin-flip/) on [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/).
